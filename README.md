## ⭐ Getting Started ⭐
Welcome to NiFT! NiFT is a online NFT library that allows users to browse, create, and buy unauthentic NFTs.<br>
<br>
The home page of NiFT showcases all the NiFTs created in a carousel, as well as trending and new NFTs listed at the bottom. On click of the selected NFT, users will be navigated to the details page which shows the price history, price, owner, about, and reviews.<br>
<br>
Users can also navigate to the Create page, which allows them to create an NFT to be featured on the page. NFT requirements consist of Username, NFT Name, Image URL, Price, and Description.

## 🤔 Why a NFT Library? 🤔
Project 3 challenged us to clone an exsiting website using a React application that included a frontend and a backend. As a group, we really enjoyed animations and art, so we thought it would be a good opportunity to create a repository for that. All the members in our group have experience in either NFT or cryptocurrencies so deciding to clone OpenSea was an easy decision. This project challenged us to take the project one step at a time, understanding how the backend works, and how to implement functionalities on the page.<br><br>

When building this project, we were able to:<br>
✅ Create a React app that houses NFTs<br>
✅ Allow users to create an NFT that is displayed on our page<br>
✅ Solidify our understanding of backend databases<br>
✅ Sharpen our React skills<br><br>

## ⏭️ Whats next? ⏭️
Here are a few stretch goals we look to accomplish in the future:<br>

📄 User authentication<br>
📄 Create NFT Collections<br>
